# Flowcosmos - DEX Aggregator

A decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that sources liquidity from various exchanges and is capable of splitting a single trade transaction across multiple DEXes.

Flowcosmos Aggregator as an essential infrastructure in the DeFi ecosystem solves the problems of liquidity fragmentation and price optimization in decentralized exchanges (DEXes).

In traditional DEXes, liquidity is often dispersed across different exchanges, requiring users to trade on multiple platforms and preventing them from obtaining the best prices. This results in high slippage and additional transaction costs for users.

Flowcosmos addresses these issues by aggregating liquidity from multiple DEXes onto one platform, providing users with better trade quotes. By optimized trade routing algorithms, Flowcosmos finds the optimal trade path to achieve the best trade prices and minimize slippage.

Furthermore, Flowcosmos bridges the liquidity gaps between DEXes. By connecting multiple DEXes, Flowcosmos enables users to access liquidity from various exchanges on a single platform, delivering an improved trading experience.

Meanwhile, Flowcosmos has integrated the fcl SDK into the Cocos game engine https://www.cocos.com/en. Compared to Unity, Cocos is known for being lightweight, open-source, and cross-platform, making it an ideal choice for Web3 dApps that require seamless canvas rendering in a browser environment. These features have also helped Cocos gain a significant market share in the mobile game and HTML5 markets. By incorporating Cocos into Flowcosmos, we aim to further expand the potential ecosystem of Flow.
